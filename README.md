### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm looking for a new developer role in Brisbane, Australia. I've worked in the .NET Ecosystem since 2013 (10 Years! Wow that makes me feel old ğŸ‘´) I've enjoyed roles in Full-Stack .NET + React/Angular/Typescript and for the last 5 years working as a .NET Xamarin developer at different startups. My ideal job would be working in .NET stack with a tight nit team ideally 4 days a week in a hybrid/WFH arrangement.
