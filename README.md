### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm looking for a .NET Full-Stack or App Development role in Brisbane, Australia. I've worked in the .NET Ecosystem since 2013 (10 Years!) and in that time I've enjoyed many different roles including in Full-Stack .NET + React/Angular/Typescript front ends, pure .net backend, Windows IoT and more. 
For the last 5+ years I've been working as a .NET Xamarin developer at different startups and have come to love the mobile app development process. The new era of .NET MAUI is upon us and it's really exciting to see the possibilities in desktop and the emergence of the new Blazor web technology in the space. 
My ideal job would be working in .NET Xamarin/MAUI with a tight knit team 4 days a week in a hybrid/WFH arrangement.
